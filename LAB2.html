    <h3>Aims</h3>
    <p>
              This project-based unit focuses on developing your skills to build web applications 
        using web technologies. You'll work individually and in teams to tackle real-world 
        web development challenges, building proficiency in selecting and applying suitable 
        tools and techniques. The unit also covers essential aspects of security, ethics, 
        accessibility, and professional communication within web development. Guidance 
        from an academic facilitator will support you in mastering both technical skills and 
        collaborative project management techniques to achieve these objectives.
